# Vans-Webiste-Project

My recreation of the Vans homepage. I just googled the pictures. :)

a) I wanted a refresher on my HTML and learn the different aspects of HTML that I haven't already learned.

b) I learned how to create an input box for an email subscription and social media boxes to access the Vans social media pages.

c) I had difficulties formatting the email subscription boxes and other components. I also had difficulites finding a proper color scheme to make my website aesthetically pleasing.

d) I would add more pictures and special features to use up the extra white space. I would also change the link colors to match the color scheme.
